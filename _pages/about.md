I am a senior undergraduate student at Istanbul Technical University. I have done projects involving graph deep learning and recommender systems during my junior year and currently I am working on predictive modeling. After completing my undergraduate degree, I want to work on explainability, causality, few shot learning,  and lifelong learning.
